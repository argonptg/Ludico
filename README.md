# Ludico

**A universal game launcher and downloader for Linux, built with C#, .NET 6, and Gtk#.**

Ludico is a high-performance, universal platform for game launching. It is written in C# and uses Gtk# to create a native GTK 3 interface. The project starts by supporting plugins from [Project GLD](https://github.com/Y0URD34TH/Project-GLD), with future plans to integrate sources from [Hydra](https://github.com/hydralauncher/hydra).

## Why Ludico?

The landscape of open-source game launchers has become fragmented, leading to multiple, incompatible plugin formats. Ludico aims to solve this by unifying the most popular plugin and source formats into a single, powerful application, providing a streamlined experience for both gamers and developers on Linux.

## Features

  - **Native GTK 3 Interface:** Built with Gtk# to provide a stable, fast, and classic interface that integrates well with the Linux desktop.
  - **Project GLD Compatibility:** Implements the plugin specification from Project GLD.
  - **Future-Proof Design:** Planned support for Hydra's "source" format to create a truly unified launcher.

## Implementation Status

The immediate development focus is on the core UI and achieving full compatibility with the Project GLD plugin format.

### Project GLD Plugin Status

The table below tracks the implementation status for **Project GLD's** methods:

| Method        | Status     | Description                                     |
|---------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Client`      | üü° Partial | Missing functions for Loading, Unloading and Save Paths |
| `JsonWrapper` | ‚úÖ Implemented | Handles basic JSON-based plugin definitions.    |
| `Game`        | ‚úÖ Implemented | Manages game-specific data and actions.         |
| `Game Library`| ‚ùå Not Planned | For managing the user's library of games.       |
| `Menu`        | ‚ùå Not Planned | For creating custom menu entries.               |
| `HTTP`        | ‚úÖ Implemented | Allows plugins to make HTTP requests.           |
| `Utils`       | ‚ùå Planned | General utility functions for plugins.          |
| `Communication`| üü° Partial | Plugin-C# communication is being written  |
| `File`        | ‚ùå Planned | For reading and writing files.                  |
| `Settings`    | ‚ùå Not Planned | Allows plugins to modify Ludico's settings   |
| `Download`    | ‚ùå Planned | A robust system for managing game downloads.    |
| `Notifications`| ‚úÖ Implemented | Provides native desktop notifications.          |
| `SteamAPI`    | ‚ùå Not Planned | Integration with the Steam API.                 |
| `Zip`         | ‚ùå Planned | For handling compressed archive files.          |
| `GLDConsole`  | ‚ùå Not Planned | Access to the Ludico logs can be had by running it via the terminal |
| `DLL`         | ‚ùå Not Planned | Support for DLL injection into apps |

### Future: Hydra Source Support

Once the core UI and GLD implementation are stable, work will begin on integrating support for Hydra's "source" system.
